# Node.js Server Unresponsive Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server starts but fails to respond to incoming requests. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  This is often caused by improper error handling or asynchronous operation mishaps within the request listener.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to observe the problematic behavior.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version in action.
